Wrap <pre> or <code> tags around the textarea for the Plain text version of the email.

Should allow people without Users Addon to create a list.

But when folks have the user addon installed, we can test the emails against their users and create relationships with them.  We could also have a tool to sync the lists with the users or call out any differences there may be.

Then we can have a fieldtype that someone can assign to the users channel that shows which lists a particular user is on and gives folks the option to manage which lists they are on.  Master Blaster Lists should just link to the normal members whenever possible.  If custom data is needed, Users is needed.  By default we just store email.


TEXT: need to wrap text at 60 characters.


Google Analytics Campaign Links: CM will do this for us at first, but when we move to sending our own emails, we can also enable Google Analytics to be dynamically added to certain domain links.

------------------------------------------------------------

Campaigns
- Create Campaigns Based on Sections
- Create a Campaign with the Template Editor
  - Assign a template to  Campaign
-Assign List to Campaign

Send
- Send Test Emails
- Send Actual Emails

Lists
- Add people to list
- Remove people from list
- Create code for a sign up form.

------------------------------------------------------------

How does a campaign work?  Is it dynamic in that if it's based off
a section and a template the content can be edited and will be reflected 
in the campaign?  Or is it static in that once you pull in the section, 
we create an instance of that information that we use on our own.  And then
perhaps, before blasting, you could reimport that data if you wanted.  But
then we have a local version of the actual thing that got sent to refer
to for the future in case other things change.

Is there any way to have an "Email Dev Mode" where all emails generated by the system get sent to one single address?


------------------ notes ----------------------
- email service settings (CampaignMonitor, MailChimp, etc) will be in a tab next to the main campaign listings.
- a campaign based on a section will provide a campaign for each of that section's entries in the campaign listing
( so a campaign is assigned to a section, but the list pulls all the entries for the sections and displays
 as a campaign)
 - a section template will be located in the front end templates dir
 - an entry id will be made available in the the email template, preferably behaving just like a craft entry template
 - campaign 'export' means create a campaign via api, but do not send
 - campaign 'send' means 'export' and then trigger a send from the service
 - if an email service is selected, the user must select an exisiting recipient list from the service
 
 
 ------------------ notification notes ---------------
 - create a separate tab next to campaigns for notifications
 - handle craft/system events first; when an event is fired, retrieve all possible data that came with
 the event and make it available to all notification templates html/text template (textarea); for example, if a form is 
 submitted, make $_POST['email'] available as form.email
 - there is a one-to-one relationship between a notification and an event
 - there is a one-to-many realtionship between a notifcation and email sent (one notification can trigger
 unlimited emails)
